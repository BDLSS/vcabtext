This is a quick guide to setting up a demo system. It assumes
you have a Linux system and was tested with Ubuntu 12.04.

1. Setup libraries need on the server

sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install --upgrade django==1.6
sudo apt-get install git-core
sudo apt-get install python-pygments


2. Download and run the setup script:

wget https://github.com/BDLSS/vcabtext/raw/master/djsetup.py
chmod u+x djsetup.py
sudo ./djsetup.py -s

This will setup the folders needed and includes git pulling the
latest version and trying to configure certain settings.


3. Since we are using the Django dev server rather
than Apache we need to fix file permissions.
(enter the username of who will be running the server when prompted) 

sudo ./djsetup.py -f


4. Setup and load the database with test data

cd /opt/oxproject/current/vocabdj
./manage.py syncdb
./restore.sh load

If you see message about "No fixture data" don't worry about it.

5. To make it available to remote clients, find your IP and pass it when
starting up the Django development server. If installed on a
desktop you can just run it without the IP and it will
use 127.0.0.1:8000 by default.

ifconfig
./manage.py runserver 123.456.78.9:8000
