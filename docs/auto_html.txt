This document explains automatic html options.

A. Start process
----------------
1. Add a new format in the admin interface.
2. The format is usually an acronym, so these are required fields.
3. Save it.

B. Html convert method
----------------------
You can add the method to use or leave it blank for
the default. The following option are valid:
1. pygments (default)
2. rdfxslt

B1. Pygments convert options
----------------------------
You can define the following options or leave it
blank for the default. Here are three examples:
	a. lexer
	b. lexer, linenos
	c. guess, linenos, example.ext

B1a. lexer
Predefined valid lexers are: xml, xslt, json
The default lexer is: xml
An invalid lexer causes the TextLexer to be used.
	xml

B1b. linenos
The word 'linenos' controls if output should have
line numbers. Anything else stops them appearing.
	xml, linenos
	xml, False

B1c. guess
There are (in June 2013) a total 240 predefined lexers
within pygments. This option will try and use them.
* You must give an example filename where the extension used
will be used to guess the lexer.
* If it cannot guess it the TextLexer will be used.

An example tested:
	guess, linenos, example.xsd
	
B2. rdfxslt
-----------
This method will try and create HTML documentation for an RDF file
using an XSLT document. 

1. Add the XSL you wish to use to the document store and note the id number.
2. Add rdfxslt to format html method
3. Put the ID number in the html options.

It will fallback to using B1.
