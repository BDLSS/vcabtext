Pre-setup

Setup
=====
The python script djsetup.py automates some of the setting up in the /opt folder.

It also does other things. Calling with no options will show you help.
  ./djsetup

The -g option will download the new latest version and prefix the old
one with a time stamp.
  ./djsetup -g


Development setup
-----------------
There are three stages.

Stage A: setup opt
- - - - - - - - - -
1. You need to create the make the directories needed.
sudo ./djsetup -m

2. Change ownership of folders to your login.
sudo ./djsetup -f

Stage B: setup django
- - - - - - - - - - - -
3. When in the vocabdj folder of this project the django sync works.
./manage.py syncdb

4. You can run the test server.
./manage.py runserver

OR
4a. Get your IP address. (eg. eth0... inet addr: ipaddress)
ifconfig

4b. Make test server available to subnet on port 7000
./manage.py runserver ipaddress:7000

Stage C: load dumped data.
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
5. If data has been 'dumped' in the fixtures folders you can load it.
./restore load
NOTE: if flatpages does not contain an item '/' you will get a 404 error n


Production setup
----------------
There is are two stages. But the webserver still needs setting up.

Stage A: pre-setup
- - - - - - - - - -
1. wget https://github.com/bdlss/vcabtext/raw/master/djsetup.py
2. chmod u+x djsetup.py
3. sudo ./djsetup -a
The third option will apt-get the required libraries.

If using Virtual Envs

1. When in the folder you keep your Python virtualenvs: virturalenv vocab_dj1.5
2. Activate it.
3. pip install django==1.5
4. pip install pygments
5. pip install lxml

Step 5 will compile so needs build tools. Also, since the Python is just
a wrapper that use the installed C versions of lxml. You will need to
install this first. See dependencies for the system package: python-lxml
which at time of writing is: (libc6, libxml2, libxslt1.1)


Stage B: setup opt and sync latest git master
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
1. sudo ./djsetup -s
If you see message about non-django system folders ignore them.

2. cd /opt/oxproject/current/vocabdj
3. ./manage.py syncdb

If 3 fails with "OperationalError: unable to open database file" check the file permissions of where DB is kept: /opt/oxstore

This will create the database, but YOU must enable write access to it.
4. sudo ~/djsetup -d

5. Use the restore.sh script to load configuration into the database: ./restore.sh load

6. Use manage.py to run server. You should get home page, also three items get restored so the browse works. Edit via admin interface.

Stage C: get and load the fixtures
----------------------------------
1. SSH/SFTP into server so you can copy files from local machine
into fixtures folders.
2. Copy the page.json
3. cd /opt/oxproject/current/vocabdj
4. ./manage.py loaddata vadmin/fixtures/page.json
5. Goto website.
